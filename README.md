[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alem0lars/colorme.png?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/alem0lars/colorme)

## Supported ruby versions

Tested against: `2.0.0`

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'colorme'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install colorme

## Usage

At the moment the ColorME application can be started in 2 modes:
- `CMD`: This allows you to just throw commands from your favourite console.
           It allows the programmatic use for all of its features.
- `QT`: This will start the UI (written in Qt). It's the standalone application.

ColorME also separates the framework provided from the application
(which uses the framework), this allows you to use ColorME as a *powerful
color library*.
